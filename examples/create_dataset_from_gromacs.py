EXAMPLE FOR CREATING A DATASET FROM GROMACS TOP FILES AND QM DATA.

Grappa is trained on bonded energies and forces, that is, energies and forces from QM calculations subtracted by the nonbonded contribution assigned by a classical force field of choice.

Its input to a grappa model is the molecular graph equipped with partial charges used for calculating the nonbonded contribution, thus the dataset must contain for every molecule:
- Atomic numbers
- Partial charges
- Connectivity
- (Optionally: Bonded parameters of the classical force field of choice for accelerated pretraining)

The conformational training data is
- Atomic positions
- Bonded energy contribution (QM minus nonbonded of classical force field)
- Bonded force contribution (QM minus nonbonded of classical force field)

Additionally, a molecular identifier (a string) is required to make the split into train/val/test set reproducible and reliable in the case of having several conformations of the same molecule in different subdatasets.

In this example, we use a small dataset of QM energies and force for peptides and functionality from the grappa package to calculate the nonbonded contribution of the Amber99SBILDN force field in OpenMM. Thus, the OpenMM-Grappa installation is needed.
Further, a gromacs installation is required to parse the .top files.

If we want to train a grappa model, we need to store the dataset as dgl graphs and point the model towards the dataset.
The easiest way to do so is to store the dataset at grappa.utils.get_data_path()/grappa_datasets/<some_name>/*.npz and give the model <some_name> as dataset tag. Then, it can be loaded by grappa.data.Dataset.from_tag('<some_name>').

In case you want to create a dataset to fine tune grappa for a single, specific molecule or few molecules and don't want to split the dataset according to the molecule identifier but just according to different conformations, it is best practice to split the dataset yourself and store three datasets for train, val and test set and store them separately with different tags. Then set
config.data.pure_train_datasets += [train_tag]
config.data.pure_val_datasets += [val_tag]
config.data.pure_test_datasets += [test_tag]
